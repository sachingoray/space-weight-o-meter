# 🌌 space- Weight-o-Meter 🚀

A fun Python program that calculates your weight on different planets (and the Sun!) in our Solar System — with a humorous twist.  

Because sometimes, it’s not you… it’s the planet! 😉

---

## Features

- Calculate your weight on **Sun and all planets of our Solar System**  
- Includes **funny, playful messages** from each celestial body  
- Interactive **user input** for weight and planet selection  
- Friendly terminal design with separators and spacing for readability

## How It Works

1. User enters their **current weight in kilograms**.  
2. User selects a **planet** from our Solar System (or the Sun).  
3. Program calculates the **weight on the selected celestial body** using its gravity relative to Earth.  
4. Displays the weight in kg and a **fun message/fact** from that planet.
